Angular, Google’s TypeScript based web application framework is currently at version 11, but I would like to talk about a very powerful and sadly neglected feature of Angular that was added to it back in version 6. That feature is Angular Elements.

This year I was tasked to incorporate several Angular components into an existing ASP.NET Core application. There was already a messy solution implemented, involving an enormous script which loaded a classic Angular app with all the components, regardless of their relevance to the current page, which, obviously, was not efficient in terms of speed and size.

Also, this approach was a hell in terms of software development process, which required me to run a Gulp script, rebuild the ASP.NET app and hard reload the page every time I changed a tiny bit of CSS. The team was not happy with neither the app performance, nor the development process, so my objective was to:

1. Create a new solution, which will allow to incorporate a single Angular component inside a page, rather than the whole application.
2. Would work faster and not load huge, unnecessary scripts.
3. Would allow for faster dev build times with no need of constant script rerun.

So, naturally, I turned to **Web Components**.

## What are Web Components?

Web Components are the concept of components from frameworks like React or Angular, but built for the web overall in a framework-agnostic way. What does that mean?

We are used to our simple HTML tags in our UI. For example, we know tags like `div`, `span`, and others. They have predefined behavior, and may be used in different places of our view.

Web Components essentially allow us to create new HTML tags/elements using JavaScript. Let’s see a small example of how this is done, purely with JavaScript.

```js
class SpanWithText extends HTMLSpanElement {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.innerText = `Hello, I am a Web Component`;
    }
}

customElements.define(`span-with-text`, SpanWithText);
```

Here we create a class which extends from `HTMLElement` (`HTMLSpanElement` in our case, to be more precise), and whenever this element is created, it will have a `innerText` with value `Hello, I am a Web Component`. So, whenever we use our element in the DOM, it will already have the populated text inside itself. We then register our new element with a custom tag and we are ready to use it:

```html
<span-with-text></span-with-text>
```

Of course, it would be great to be able to turn our Angular Components into Web Components and use them wherever we want, no matter the environment. And turns out, with the use of **Angular Elements**, we can do precisely that.

## Getting Started

Let’s start by creating a new ASP.NET Core 5 web application. For this, make sure that you have the latest version of [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.

Open your favorite terminal, and enter the following command:

```sh
dotnet new webapp -o aspnetwebapp
```

You can then run the app:


```sh
cd aspnetwebapp
dotnet watch run
```

Then, let’s continue by creating a new Angular project inside our ASP.NET project. For this, make sure that you have the latest version of Angular CLI installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Once this install is complete, we can use it to create a new initial application in our system.

```sh
ng new AngularApp
```

Angular CLI will ask you a couple of questions for configuring your project. Answer ‘yes’ to enforcing strict mode (helps writing better TypeScript and minimizing bundles sizes) and ‘no’ to adding Angular Router (since our routing will be handled by the ASP.NET Core router).

The CLI installs the necessary Angular packages and dependencies in a folder called AngularApp. You can serve this application on to the browser by running the following commands:

```sh
cd angular-app
ng serve --open
```

Our project setup is now complete and we can start coding.

## Creating the Component

As you can see, the app contains already contains a few things that we can display on the screen. But we don’t need them. So go back to your code editor and delete everything inside `src/app/app.component.html` file and write a single `<h1>` element.

```html
<h1>Welcome to Angular Elements in ASP.NET Core 5</h1>
```

If you take a look at the file structure, you will see that each component in Angular consists of a multitude of files. For the `App` component alone, there is a `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, and a `spec.ts` file that contains the tests, and a `module.ts` file. There would also be an optional `routing.module.ts` file if you had chosen to add the routing feature to the application while creating it using the CLI.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image1} />

Instead of writing all these files for our components, Angular CLI gives us a shorthand method that will **generate** these files for us. Let’s use this method to create a `MyAngularElements` component in our system.

```sh
ng generate component MyAngularElements
```

This single command will create a folder named `my-angular-elements` inside the `src/app` folder. If you open this file, you will find these 4 files inside it:

* `my-angular-elements.component.css`
* `my-angular-elements.component.html`
* `my-angular-elements.component.spec.ts`
* `my-angular-elements.component.ts`

We will only be using the `.html` and `.ts` files. There are additional flags that we can pass to the `ng generate component` command to avoid creating the other files. But in order to keep things simple and to point, I won’t use them. Check [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/cli/generate#component-command) to know more about how to use this command.

We will create a component that displays the current time and updates every second. Change the contents of `my-angular-elements.component.ts` to following code:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-angular-elements',
  templateUrl: './my-angular-elements.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-angular-elements.component.css']
})
export class MyAngularElementsComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  time : Date = new Date();
  private intervalID : number = 0;

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.intervalID = window.setInterval(() => {
      this.time = new Date();
    }, 1000);
  }

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    window.clearInterval(this.intervalID);
  }

  getTime() : string {
    return `${this.time.getHours()}:${this.time.getMinutes()}:${this.time.getSeconds()}`;
  }
}
```

The code is pretty straightforward if you are familiar with Angular component’s lifecycle and JavaScript’s built-in `clearInterval` function. If not, you can learn more in the documentation pages [here](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks) and [there](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval).

Next, change the contents of `my-angular-elements.component.html` to display the value returned by `getTime()` method.

```html
<p>Time is {{getTime()}}</p>
```

That’s it! Finally to use the component we just need to add it to the `app.component.html`:

```html
<h1>Welcome to Angular Elements in ASP.NET Core 5</h1>
<app-my-angular-elements></app-my-angular-elements>
```

Then the contents of `my-angular-elements.component.html` will be displayed in the browser.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image4} />

## Convert Component Into Custom Element

Right now, we have a `MyAngularElements` component that simply prints some text on the screen. Let’s take a look at how we can insert this component into the app in a more dynamic fashion. To do this, let’s replace the `app-my-angular-elements` with a `div` and a `button`. Let’s also add the `click` listener to the button, so that when someone clicks the button, the `MyAngularElements` component can be displayed. This will be handled by a `showMessage()` function. So go to the `app.component.html` page and make these changes:

```html
<h1>Welcome to Angular Elements in ASP.NET Core 5</h1>
<div id="hello"></div>
<button (click)="showMessage()">Display</button>
```

We then need to define the `showMessage()` function in the `app.component.ts` file. Here we will use regular DOM manipulation to get the `div` by selecting it using its `id`. Then, we will set the `innerHTML` property to insert the `app-my-angular-elements` component.

```ts
export class AppComponent {
  showMessage() {
    const hello = document.getElementById('hello');
    hello!.innerHTML = `<app-my-angular-elements></app-my-angular-elements>`
  }
}
```

You can go to your browser and click on the button, but I will tell you right now that nothing is going to happen. But then again, if you go the browser’s dev tools and look there, you will see that the `MyAngularElements` component is inserted.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image5} />

The reason why we can’t see the component on the screen is that Angular cannot recognize the app-my-angular-elements tag since it has been inserted into the template *dynamically*. Angular needs all the elements to be present in the template, or you need to use the dynamic component factory to instantiate the component at runtime through your code.

This is where *Angular Elements* comes into play. By using Angular Element, all we need to do is insert the tag dynamically, and Angular itself will instantiate the component for us. Let’s finally get to see how to use this component in our app. First, use the `ng add` command to install Angular Elements.

```sh
ng add @angular/elements
```

Once you have that installed, go to `app.module.ts` and make the following changes:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';
import { MyAngularElementsComponent } from './my-angular-elements/my-angular-elements.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, MyAngularElementsComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  entryComponents: [MyAngularElementsComponent],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Then in the AppModule class, write a constructor function that creates a new instance of the `createCustomElement` and pass in `MyAngularElementsComponent`.

```ts
export class AppModule {
  constructor(injector: Injector) {
    const custom = createCustomElement(MyAngularElementsComponent, {injector: injector});
  }
}
```

Along with the component, we also have to pass it the injector. The injector is something that we use to resolve the dependencies. With that, we have created an instance of the `MyAngularElementsComponent` as a custom element. We can then use the `customElements` API to define the component’s tag as `app-my-angular-elements`.

```ts
export class AppModule {
  constructor(injector: Injector) {
    const custom = createCustomElement(MyAngularElementsComponent, {injector: injector});
    customElements.define('app-my-angular-elements', custom);
  }
}
```

The final code should be:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';
import { MyAngularElementsComponent } from './my-angular-elements/my-angular-elements.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, MyAngularElementsComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  entryComponents: [MyAngularElementsComponent],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(injector: Injector) {
    const custom = createCustomElement(MyAngularElementsComponent, {injector: injector});
    customElements.define('app-my-angular-elements', custom);
  }
}
```

Go back to the `my-angular-elements.component.ts` file and remove the `selector` inside the `@Component` section. This way, Angular will not get confused and will know to use the custom element that we just created.

Rerun the `ng serve --open` command to make sure that Angular takes in all the changes that we have just made.

## Compiling as a Standalone Element

The great benefit of creating custom elements is that they can be compiled into standalone script files that can then be added to different frameworks. This truly makes Angular Elements a powerful toolkit. Lets take a look at how we convert our custom element into a standalone script file which we will load into our ASP.NET Core project.

Go to `app.module.ts` and remove the `AppComponent` from the `declarations` field of `@NgModule`. Also remove the `boostrap` field completely and add a `ngDoBootstrap` function inside the AppModule class to tell Angular to handle the bootstrapping for us.

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';
import { MyAngularElementsComponent } from './my-angular-elements/my-angular-elements.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyAngularElementsComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  entryComponents: [MyAngularElementsComponent],
  providers: []
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(injector: Injector) {
    const custom = createCustomElement(MyAngularElementsComponent, {injector: injector});
    customElements.define('app-my-angular-elements', custom);
  }
  ngDoBootstrap() { }
}
```

Since we don’t need the `AppComponent` anymore, we can delete all the files related to it. So, go ahead and remove the `app.component.css`, `app.component.html`, `app.component.spec.ts `and `app.component.ts` files. Be careful to **not** delete the `app.module.ts` file.

This is how your app’s folder structure should look:

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image2} />

We can now set up the build process for our `MyAngularElementsComponent`. All we need to do is run:

```sh
ng build AngularApp --prod --output-hashing=none --watch
```

You will now see a `dist` folder created in your project directory, and it contains a couple of files inside it.

<GatsbyImage image={props.embedded.image3} />

The three `.js` files, `runtime.js`, `polyfills.js` and `main.js` contain all the code needed to describe our component in pure JavaScript and **must** be included in HTML *in the same order*. We could manually copy & paste them into `wwwroot` folder, but since this would be tedious and since we have to deal with multiple output files and calling order is important, it is a good idea to concatenate them into a single script which we can then import into our ASP.NET Core project.

We could use any tool we prefer, like `gulp` or `grunt`, but we will take advantage of ASP.NET Core’s built-in bundling and minifying mechanism to greatly simplify things. This is also the reason behind creating the Angular project inside ASP.NET Core project. To enable bundling/minifying just add the [BuildBundlerMinifier](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BuildBundlerMinifier) NuGet package:

```sh
dotnet add package BuildBundlerMinifier
```

and then create a new JSON file at the project’s root folder named `bundleconfig.json` and add the following contents:

```json
[   
  {
    "outputFileName": "wwwroot/js/myAngularComponent.js",
    "inputFiles": [       
      "AngularApp/dist/AngularApp/runtime.js",
      "AngularApp/dist/AngularApp/polyfills.js",
      "AngularApp/dist/AngularApp/main.js"
    ]   
  }
]
```

As you may have guessed, the `bundleconfig.json` file defines the options for each bundle. In the preceding example, a single bundle configuration is defined for concatenating and minifying Angular’s output files and sending the results to `wwwroot` folder.

We can finally use our custom Angular Elements component into ASP.NET Core. Just go to `Index.cshtml` and change its contents to the following:

```csharp
@page
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

<h1>Welcome to Angular Elements in ASP.NET Core 5</h1>
<app-my-angular-elements></app-my-angular-elements>

@section Scripts {
    <script src="~/js/myAngularComponent.js" defer></script>
}
```

Then, run

```sh
dotnet run
```

and voilà!

## Epilogue

Congrats! You have now reached the end of this post. You can now use Angular Elements to:

* Turn a regular Angular Component into a custom element
* Compile that custom element so that it can be used in a standalone capacity
* Insert the Angular Component into other frameworks like ASP.NET Core or even JavaScript libraries such as React and Vue
